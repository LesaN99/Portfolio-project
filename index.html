                <p class="details mb-5">
                    In this particular project I had to create a landing page about something I am passionate
                    about and disclaimer I very much have a lot I am passionate about but at that moment my love 
                    for scented candles kicked in. I decided to create a landing page about scented candles, hence
                    the name Scented Galore which "galore" in "slang" term means emphasising that something you 
                    like exits in very large quantities, which indeed scented candles exist in large quantities.
                    <br />
                    You are probably wondering why candles in particular?
                    Well for me particularly it has to be the thought behind creating varieties of candles with 
                    different added benefits, the creativity, the process of different ingredients to get the 
                    desired outcome and the fact that you will not just burn a candle for the sake of just
                    burning it but you will burn a candle and benefit from it.
                    Be it improving your mood, memory etc. It is all just good VIBES.
